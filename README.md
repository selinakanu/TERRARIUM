My first project on front-end foxes enatiled  building a terrarium; it is a small drag and drop code-meditation. With a little HTML, JS and CSS, by which you can build a web interface, style it, and add an interaction.

I learnt to build this terraruim using the knowledge gained from the lessons provided
on Html, CSS, Dom and javascript and i deployed it using github. 

The terrarium artwork was drawn by  [Jen Looper](http://jenlooper.com) using Procreate.

Initially, it was a bit of challenge but i had to dedicate most of my time studying the lessons, inspectig my files, asking questions for clarifications.

## credits
